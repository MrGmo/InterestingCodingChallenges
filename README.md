# freeCodeCamp

Hi there!

This repo is comprised of the answers to the coding challenges in the Free Code Camp Algorithms and Data Structures course. It's just one large file so the last coding challenge in the course is actually the first one in the JS file. I realized that posting my solutions might be helpful to new devs going through the course.
